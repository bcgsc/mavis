# Resource Requirements

MAVIS has been tested on both unix and linux systems. For the standard
pipeline, the validation stage is the most computationally expensive.
The memory and cpu requirements will vary with two main factors: the
number of structural variants you are validating per job, and the size
of the bam file you are validating against.

There are a number of settings that can be adjusted to reduce memory and
cpu requirements depending on what the user is trying to analyze. See
[configuration and settings](../../configuration/general/) for more details.

## Validation Resources

![validation resources](../images/colo829_tumour_validation_resource_req.png)

Resource Requirements (MAVIS 1.8.0) for each validation job of the
COLO829 tumour genome. The BAM file for the tumour genome is 127GB.
Validation jobs were tested splitting into: 100, 500, 1000, and 2500
structural variant validations per job. The effect of number of events
validated on both memory and time is plotted
above.

## Annotation Resources

Similar trends were observed for the annotation step (see below) with
regards to time elapsed. However the memory requirements remained more
constant which is expected since, unlike validation, anntotation does
not read more data in for more events.

Resource Requirements (MAVIS 1.8.0) for each annotation job of the
COLO829 tumour genome. The events which passed validation (see above)
represent the number of events input to the annotation
step.
