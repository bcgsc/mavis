## Fusion Diagrams

These are diagrams produced during the annotate step. These represent
the putative fusion events of a single breakpoint pair.

Fusion from transcriptome data. Intronic breakpoints here indicate
retained intron sequence and a novel exon is
predicted.

If the [draw_fusions_only](../../configuration/settings/#draw_fusions_only flag is set to
False then all events will produce a diagram, even anti-sense fusions

## Transcript Overlays

MAVIS supports generating diagrams of all transcripts for a given gene.
These can be overlaid with markers and bam\_file pileup data. This is
particularly useful for visualizing splice site mutations.

RB1 splice site mutation results in skipping of exon 9

The above diagram was generated using the overlay command

```bash
mavis overlay RB1 \
    -o /path/to/output/dir \
    --read_depth_plot rna /path/to/bam/file \
    --marker M1 48939029 \
    --annotations /path/to/mavis/annotations/reference/file
```
