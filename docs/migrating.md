# Migrating

## Migrating from v2 to v3

There are major changes from v2 to v3 of MAVIS.

### Tab File Headers

Tab file headers no longer start with `#`. Any lines starting with a pound will be treated
as comments. This will apply to mavis-style inputs as well as any tab delimited
reference files

### Configuration

MAVIS no longer uses command line arguments, config files, and environment variables for
configuration. Instead all configurable settings are controlled via a single input JSON
config file

### Scheduling

MAVIS is now integrated with snakemake instead of handling its own scheduling
