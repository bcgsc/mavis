# MAVIS standard input file format

These requirements pertain to the columns of input files from the
various tools you want to merge. The input files should be tab-delimited
text files. Comments at the top of may be included. Comments should
begin with hash marks. They will be ignored when the file is read

```text
## This is a comment
```

The header row contains the column names and is the first row following
the comments (or the first row if no comments are included).

```text
## This is a comment
## this is another comment
# this is also a comment
This    Is  The Header
```

A simple input file might look as follows

```text
## File created at: 2018-01-02
## Generated by: MAVIS v1.0.0
break1_chromosome  break1_position_start   break1_position_end break2_chromosome break2_position_start break2_position_end
X   1234    1234    X   77965   77965
```

## Required Columns

- [break1_chromosome](../../outputs/columns/#break1_chromosome)
- [break1_position_start](../../outputs/columns/#break1_position_start)
- [break1_position_end](../../outputs/columns/#break1_position_end) (can be the same as break1\_position\_start)
- [break2_chromosome](../../outputs/columns/#break2_chromosome)
- [break2_position_start](../../outputs/columns/#break2_position_start)
- [break2_position_end](../../outputs/columns/#break2_position_end) (can be the same as break2\_position\_start)

## Optional Columns

Optional Columns that are not given as input will be added with default
(or command line parameter options) during the clustering stage of MAVIS
as some are required for subsequent pipeline steps

- [break1_strand](../../outputs/columns/#break1_strand) (defaults to not-specified during clustering)
- [break1_orientation](../../outputs/columns/#break1_orientation) (expanded to all possible values during clustering)
- [break2_strand](../../outputs/columns/#break2_strand) (defaults to not-specified during clustering)
- [break2_orientation](../../outputs/columns/#break2_orientation) (expanded to all possible values during clustering)
- [opposing_strands](../../outputs/columns/#opposing_strands) (expanded to all possible values during clustering)
- [stranded](../../outputs/columns/#stranded) (defaults to False during clustering)
- [library](../../outputs/columns/#library) (defaults to command line library parameter during clustering)
- [protocol](../../outputs/columns/#protocol) (defaults to command line protocol parameter during clustering)
- [tools](../../outputs/columns/#tools) (defaults to an empty string during clustering)

## Summary by Pipeline Step

The different pipeline steps of MAVIS have different input column
requirements. These are summarized below (for the pipeline steps which
can act as the pipeline start)

| column name                                                           | cluster | annotate | validate |

| [event_type](../../outputs/columns/#event_type)                       |         |          |          |

Some native tool outputs are [supported](../../inputs/support/#sv-callers) and
have built in methods to convert to the above format. Any unsupported
tools can be used as long as the user converts the tools native output
to match the above format.
