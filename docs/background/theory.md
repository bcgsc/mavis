# Theory and Models

## Introduction

In MAVIS structural variants (SVs) are defined by a pair of breakpoints

And a breakpoint is defined by

1. chromosome
2. base-pair range (start, end). This has a length of 1 for exact calls and more for uncertain/non-specific calls
3. [orientation](../../glossary/#orientation). This is Left or Right with respect to the positive/forward strand. This defines which portion of the genome is 'retained'
4. [strand](../../glossary/#strand). (only applicable to stranded transcriptome libraries)

So then a breakpoint pair is any two intervals on the reference genome
which are adjacent in the mutant genome

## Evidence

There are many ways that single reads or paired-end reads can act as
support for an SV call.

![read evidence](../images/read_evidence.svg)

In the figure above the red rectangle represents a deletion structural
variant. The arrows are types of single or paired-end reads supporting
the event: [flanking read pair](../../glossary/#flanking-read-pair)s (F),
[split read](../../glossary/#split_read)s (S),
[half-mapped read](../../glossary/#half-mapped-read)s (H), and
[spanning read](../../glossary/#spanning_read)s
(N).

### Types of Flanking evidence

One of the most confusing parts about working with contig and paired-end
reads is relating them to the breakpoint so that you can determine which
types will support an event. The flanking read types we outline here are
similarly described by
[IGV](http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/interpreting_insert_size).
We have used similar coloring for the read pairs in the following
diagrams to facilitate ease of use for those already familiar with
viewing bam files in IGV.

!!! note
    The major assumptions here are that the 'normal' read-pair is a read
    pair which has one read on the positive/forward strand and its partner
    on the negative/reverse strand. It is assumed that partners share a read
    name, as is the case for Illumina reads.

#### Deletion

For a deletion, we expect the flanking reads to be in the normal
orientation but that the fragment size should be abnormal (for large
deletions).

![deletion supporting read pairs](../images/read_pairs_deletion.svg)

Flanking read pair evidence for a deletion event. the read pairs will
have a larger than expected fragment size when mapped to the reference
genome because in the mutant genome they are closer together, owing to
the deletion event. (B1) The first breakpoint which has a left
orientation. (B2) The second breakpoint which has a right orientation.
Both breakpoints would be on the positive strand (assuming that the
input is stranded) which means that the first read in the pair would be
on the positive strand and the second read in the pair would be on the
negative/reverse
strand.

#### Insertion

![insertion supporting read pairs](../images/read_pairs_insertion.svg)

Flanking read pair evidence for an insertion event. The read pairs
will have a smaller than expected fragment size when mapped to the
reference genome because in the mutant genome they are father apart,
owing to the insertion event. (B1) The first breakpoint which has a left
orientation. (B2) The second breakpoint which has a right orientation.
Both breakpoints would be on the positive strand (assuming that the
input is stranded) which means that the first read in the pair would be
on the positive strand and the second read in the pair would be on the
negative/reverse
strand.

#### Duplication

![duplication support read pairs](../images/read_pairs_duplication.svg)

Flanking read pair evidence for a tandem duplication event. The read
pairs will have an abnormal orientation but still the same strands as
the normal read pair. (B1) The first breakpoint will be on the positive
strand and have a right orientation. (B2) The second breakpoint will be
on the positive strand and have a left
orientation.

#### Inversion

![inversion supporting read pairs](../images/read_pairs_inversion_LL.svg)

Flanking read pair evidence for an inversion. Both breakpoints have
left orientation.

![inversion supporting read pairs](../images/read_pairs_inversion_RR.svg)

Flanking read pair evidence for an inversion. Both breakpoints have
right orientation.

#### Translocation

![translocation supporting read pairs](../images/read_pairs_translocation_LR.svg)

Flanking read pair evidence for a translocation. (B1) the first
breakpoint with a left orientation. (B2) the second breakpoint with a
right
orientation.

![translocation supporting read pairs](../images/read_pairs_translocation_RL.svg)

Flanking read pair evidence for a translocation. (B1) the first
breakpoint with a right orientation. (B2) the second breakpoint with a
left
orientation.

#### Inverted Translocation

![translocation supporting read pairs](../images/read_pairs_translocated_inversion_LL.svg)

Flanking read pair evidence for an inverted translocation. Both
breakpoints have left
orientation.

![translocation supporting read pairs](../images/read_pairs_translocated_inversion_RR.svg)

Flanking read pair evidence for an inverted translocation. Both
breakpoints have right
orientation.

### Compatible Flanking Pairs

For insertion and duplication events compatible flanking pairs are
collected. This means that flanking pairs that support a duplication may
be used as compatible flanking evidence for an insertion (in the same
region) and similarly flanking pairs which support an insertion may be
compatible flanking evidence for a duplication

![compatible flanking pairs](../images/compatible_flanking_pairs.svg)

The event depicted above may be called as either a duplication or an
insertion (depending on the input call). If the even were called as a
duplication the reads in green would be the flanking supoprt and the
reads in blue would be given as compatible flanking support. If the
event were called as an insertion the reverse would
apply.

### Calculating the Evidence Window

![read pair defn terms](../images/read_pair_definitions.svg)

Basic Terms used in describing read pairs are shown above: fragment
size: the distance between the pair; read length: the length of the
read; fragment size: the combined length of both reads and the fragment
size

We make some base assumptions with regards to paired-end read data:

!!! note
    the distribution of fragment sizes approximately follows a normal
    distribution

!!! note
    the most common fragment size is the unmutated 'normal' fragment

With the above assumptions we take the median fragment size to be the
expected normal.

Given that we expect mutations and therefore abnormal fragment sizes, we
use a modified method to calculate the **median standard deviation**
(see code below). We calculate the squared distance away from the median
for each fragment and then take a fraction of this to be 'normal'
variation. So the most abnormal portion is ignored, assuming it is
supposed to be abnormal. This results in a calculation as follows.

```python
from statistics import median
import math

fragments = [abs(read.template_length) for read in reads]  # the fragment sizes of the reads
f = 0.95 # fraction
m = median(fragments) # get the median fragment size value
X = [math.pow(i - m, 2) for i in fragments]  # take the square error for each point
end = int(round(len(X) * f))
X = sorted(X)[0:end]
stdev = math.sqrt(sum(X) / len(X))
```

This gives us an idea of when to judge an fragment size as abnormal and
where we expect our normal read pairs fragment sizes to fall.

![read pair fragment size histogram](../images/fragment_sizes_histogram.svg)

Distribution of fragment sizes (absolute values) of proper read pairs.
The black curve representings the fit for a normal distribution using
the standard deviation calculated with all data points. The blue curve
is the expected distribution using a 0.95 fraction of the data. The
thick vertical black line is the median and the thin black lines are
standard deviations away from the
median.

As we can see from the diagram above, removing the outliers reproduces
the observed distribution better than using all data points

We use this in two ways

1. to find flanking evidence supporting deletions and insertions
2. to estimate the window size for where we will need to read from the
    bam when looking for evidence for a given event

The
`mavis.validate.evidence.GenomeEvidence._generate_window`
function uses the above concepts. The user will define the
`median_fragment_size` the `stdev_fragment_size` , and the
`stdev_count_abnormal` parameters defined in the
`mavis.constants.VALIDATION_DEFAULTS`
class.

If the library has a transcriptome protocol this becomes a bit more
complicated and we must take into account the possible annotations when
calculating the evidence window. see
`mavis.validate.evidence.TranscriptomeEvidence._generate_window` for more

### Calling Breakpoints by Flanking Evidence

Breakpoints are called by contig, split-read, or flanking pairs
evidence. Contigs and split reads are used to call exact breakpoints,
where breakpoints called by flanking reads are generally assigned a
probabilistic range.

The metrics used here are similar to those used in calculating the
evidence window. We use the
[max_expected_fragment_size](../../glossary/#max-expected-fragment-size) as the outer
limit of how large the range can be. This is further refined taking into
account the range spanned by the [flanking read pair](../../glossary/#flanking-read-pair) evidence and the position of the opposing breakpoint.

![call by flanking reads](../images/call_breakpoint_by_flanking_reads.svg)

Calculation of the left-oriented breakpoint by flanking reads. Reads
mapped to the breakpoint are shown in grey. The read on the right (black
outline, no fill) demonstrates the read length used to narrow the right
side bound of the [estimated breakpoint
interval.

### Determining Flanking support

![flanking support](../images/flanking_pairs_fragment_sizes_deletion.svg)

After a breakpoint has been called we can narrow the interval of
expected fragment sizes using the size of the event. (Left) The colored
portion of the graph represents the range in fragment sizes we expect
for a normal/unmutated genome. (Right) For a deletion event we expect
the fragment size to be bigger, outside the normal range. Reads that
would flank the breakpoint should follow a similar distribution to the
normal genome but the median will be shifted by the size of the event.
The shaded portion of the graph represents the range in fragment sizes
we expect for flanking pairs supporting the deletion
event.

## Classifying Events

The following decision tree is used in classifying events based on their
breakpoints. Only valid combinations have been shown. see
`mavis.breakpoint.BreakpointPair.classify`

![classifying](../images/classification_tree.svg)

Classification Decision Tree. The above diagram details the decsion
logic for classifying events based on the orientation, strand and
chromosomes or their respective
breakpoints

## Assembling Contigs

During validation, for each breakpoint pair, we attempt to assemble a
contig to represent the sequence across the breakpoints. This is
assembled from the supporting reads ([split read](../../glossary/#split-read),
[half-mapped read](../../glossary/#half-mapped-read),
[flanking read pair](../../glossary/#flanking-read-pair), and
[spanning read](../../glossary/#spanning-read)) which have already been
collected for the given event. The sequence from each read and its
reverse complement are assembled into contigs using a
[DeBruijn graph](../../glossary/#debruijn-graph). For strand specific
events, we then attempt to resolve the sequence strand of the contig.

## Annotating Events

We make the following assumptions when determining the annotations for
each event

!!! note
    If both breakpoints are in the same gene, they must also be in the same
    transcript

!!! note
    If the breakpoint intervals overlap we do not annotate encompassed genes

!!! note
    Encompassed and 'nearest' genes are reported without respect to strand

There are specific questions we want annotation to answer. We collect
gene level annotations which describes things like what gene is near the
breakpoint (useful in the case of a potential promoter swap); what genes
(besides the one selected) also overlap the breakpoint; what genes are
encompassed between the breakpoints (for example in a deletion event the
genes that would be deleted).

![gene annotations](../images/annotations_summary.svg)

Gene level annotations at each breakpoint. Note: genes which fall
between a breakpoint pair, encompassed genes, will not be present for
interchromosomal events
(translocations)

Next there are the fusion-product level annotations. If the event result
in a fusion transcript, the sequence of the fusion transcript is
computed. This is translated to a putative amino acid sequence from
which protein metrics such as the possible ORFs and domain sequences can
be computed.

## Predicting Splicing Patterns

After the events have been called and an annotation has been attached,
we often want to predict information about the putative fusion protein,
which may be a product. In some cases, when a fusion transcript disrupts
a splice-site, it is not clear what the processed fusion transcript may
be. MAVIS will calculate all possibilities according to the following
model.

![splicing pattern](../images/splicing_pattern_default.svg)

The default splicing pattern is a list of pairs of donor and acceptor
splice sites

For a given list of non-abrogated splice sites (listed 5' to 3' on the
strand of the transcript) donor splice sites are paired with all
following as seen below

![multiple donors](../images/splicing_pattern_multiple_donors.svg)

Multiple abrogated acceptors sites. As one can see above this
situation will result in 3 different splicing patterns depending on
which donor is paired with the 2nd acceptor
site

![multiple acceptors](../images/splicing_pattern_multiple_acceptors.svg)

Multiple abrogated donor sites. As one can see above this situation
will result in 3 different splicing patterns depending on which acceptor
is paired with the 2nd donor
site

More complex examples are drawn below. There are five classifications
([`mavis.constants.SPLICE_TYPE`](../../package/mavis/constants/#class-mavisconstantssplice_type)) for the
different splicing patterns:

1. Retained intron
2. Skipped exon
3. Multiple retained introns
4. Multiple skipped exons
5. Some combination of retained introns and skipped exons

![Splicing scenarios](../images/splicing_model.svg)

## Pairing Similar Events

After breakpoints have been called and annotated we often need to see if
the same event was found in different samples. To do this we will need
to compare events between genome and transcriptome libraries. For this,
the following model is proposed. To compare events between different
protocol (genome vs transcriptome) we use the annotation overlying the
genome breakpoint and the splicing model we defined above to predict
where we would expect to find the transcriptomic breakpoints. This gives
rise to the following basic cases.

!!! note
    In all cases the predicted breakpoint is either the same as the genomic
    breakpoint, or it is the same as the nearest retained donor/acceptor to
    the breakpoint.

![exonic splicing](../images/breakpoint_prediction_exonic.svg)

the transcript is retained. (A) The original splicing pattern showing
the placement of the genomic breakpoint and the retained five prime
